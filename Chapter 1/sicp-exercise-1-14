SICP exercise 1.14

1. Space.

The deepest path in the tree is the sum that is calculated by the smallest coin - pennies. 
So space used grows linearly with the order of growth O(n).

2. Time.

It's pretty hard to prove but the order of growth is polynomical. It's O(n^5) where n is an
initial sum and 5 is the number of types of coins we use. Will come back later.
